# A large value of 10 indicates that the clock is so many hops away from a
# reference clock that its time is unreliable. If the computer ever has access
# to another computer which is ultimately synchronized to a reference clock,
# it will almost certainly be at a stratum less than 10. Therefore, the choice
# of a high value like 10 for the local command prevents the machine’s own time
# from ever being confused with real time, were it ever to leak out to clients
# that have visibility of real servers.

# The log command indicates that certain information is to be logged. It
# accepts the following options:
# measurements
# This option logs the raw NTP measurements and related information to a file
# called measurements.log.
#
# statistics
# This option logs information about the regression processing to a file called
# statistics.log.
#
# tracking
# This option logs changes to the estimate of the system’s gain or loss rate,
# and any slews made, to a file called tracking.log.
#
# rtc
# This option logs information about the system’s real-time clock.
#
# refclocks
# This option logs the raw and filtered reference clock measurements to a file
# called refclocks.log.
#
# tempcomp
# This option logs the temperature measurements and system rate compensations
# to a file called tempcomp.log.
