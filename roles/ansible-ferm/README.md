Role Name
=========

Installs Ferm Firewall management and configures rules. (http://ferm.foo-projects.org/)

Requirements
------------

Define rules for each chain if desired...Custom chains can be added as the example ALLOWED-LOGGING...each rule needs a weight
assigned to each rule. The weight defines the filename and dictates the loading order of rules.. weight=000 is highest and loads first
a weight=999 would be the lowest priority and loads last.
